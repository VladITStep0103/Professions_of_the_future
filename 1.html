  <h3>"What is this site about?"</h3>
  <p class="p1">This site is about the <i>professions of the future</i>. The purpose of writing this site is to tell about professions, knowledge of which can potentially help today's youth. This site will list <i>professions that will be relevant in the future</i>.</p>
  <p class="p1">Note: of course, we do not know what professions will be relevant in the future, however, we can assume, judging by the statistics at the moment (for example: the IT sector is actively developing now, therefore it can be assumed that IT professions will be relevant in the future.)</p>
